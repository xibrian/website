I took E 157AC: Engineering, Environment, Society in Spring 2023 with Khalid Kadir. 
We learned about environmental justice and had the opportunity to apply concepts from class by working with community-based organizations in the Bay Area. My team worked with Climate Resilient Communities, an East Palo Alto based organization that 
works with frontline residents to implement equitable, just climate solutions.

East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and North Fair Oaks have an extraordinary number of toxic sites from past manufacturing operations, redlining, and other racist practices. At the same time, this region (San Mateo County) is the most vulnerable county in California to sea level rise. Many toxic sites in this area remain unremediated to this day, and rising sea levels could flood toxic sites and mobilize contamiants, harming local communities. Our team's project involved providing a more granular picture of these toxic sites, including information on threats of sea level and groundwater rise, types of toxic site hazards, potential healh hazards, responsible cleanup authorities, and the extent to which cleanup has happened.
