I took CS 160: User Interface Design and Development over Summer 2023. I learned how to design, evaluate, and prototype user interfaces; this class culminated in a final group project where we designed a web application for college backpacking students at UC Berkeley.

Managing the project from start to end, we used concepts like user interviews, task analysis, Figma prototypes, heuristic evaluations, frontend web development with React, and user evaluations.

Here is our [final report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTCK1n9yGzaBvABFKofuzQuvaw1yHeJRciI2aXEVFjE/edit?usp=sharing) documenting our work.
