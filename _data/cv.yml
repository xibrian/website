      institution: Software Development Engineer Intern
      year: May 2022 - Aug 2022
      description:
        - Wanting to gain more software engineering experience after liking this work the summer prior, I interned at Amazon after my sophomore year. I contributed to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/healthlake/">Amazon HealthLake</a>, a service that allows healthcare providers to digitize, store, and analyze health information on the cloud. Like most digital healthcare platforms, HealthLake follows the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR</a> standard, which defines how digital health information is stored and exchanged.
        - When customers upload medical text (like doctor's notes) onto HealthLake, they can opt for it to be processed by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/">Amazon Comprehend Medical</a>, an NLP service that extracts medical procedures, conditions, and prescriptions from text. However, these NLP results weren't FHIR compliant, so my work over the summer consisted of converting unstructured, NLP results into FHIR resources.

      institution: Data Science Pathways Intern
      year: May 2021 - Jan 2022
      description:
        - My longstanding interest in public transit as a means for building better cities and developing sustainably led me to the Volpe Center. I worked with Alexander Epstein, PhD in the <a href="https://www.volpe.dot.gov/our-work/policy-planning-and-environment/energy-analysis-and-sustainability">Energy Analysis and Sustainability Division</a>. I worked on the <a href="https://blindzonecalculator.herokuapp.com/">VIEW</a> (Visibility in Elevated Wide Vehicles) vehicle blind zone tool. The platform generates a standardized visibility score based on the extent to which the driver's perspective is obstructed (by the front hood, outside mirrors, etc.). We developed it in response to the increasing number of traffic-related fatalities due to drivers not seeing pedestrians.
        - I built a <a href="https://blindzonecalculator.herokuapp.com/visualize">"Visualize"</a> page that displays information for all vehicles (including visibility scores, blind zone visualizations, vehicle makes, models, years, etc.). I also worked on NYC's efforts to electrify its municipal fleet by compiling agency interviews, viewable <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/fleet/clean-fleet-transition-plan-october-2022.pdf">here</a>.

        - With the extra time during the first wave of COVID, I wanted to improve my writing. I worked as a writing intern for <a href="https://studybreaks.com/">Study Breaks</a>, an online magazine written by college students across the country, focused on Gen Z topics. I wrote article pieces ranging from current events, to the many COVID-induced closures, and niche topics I was passionate about. A complete collection of my writing is available <a href="https://studybreaks.com/author/brian-xi-university-of-california-berkeley">here</a>.
        - Some articles I'm most proud of include <a href="https://studybreaks.com/thoughts/christo-jeanne-claude/">Christo and Jeanne-Claude</a>, <a href="https://studybreaks.com/college/eliminating-sat-act/">UC standardized testing</a>, and <a href="https://studybreaks.com/thoughts/muji/">MUJI</a>.

        - I've always been passionate about the arts and art museum experience. In high school, I was part of the Phoenix Art Museum's Teen Art Council for two years. Created to provide a unique perspective to the museum's teen programs, we organized First Friday booths, learned about the curatorial process, and curated an exhibition on 20th century abstract art called <a href="https://phxart.org/exhibition/color-vibrations/#:~:text=Spanning%20from%20the%20mid%2D1940s,personal%2C%20political%2C%20and%20philosophical.">Color Vibrations</a>.
