description: to make or not make playlists?
---
While driving with a friend over winter break, we started talking about our Spotify listening habits. The way I see it, there's two schools of thought:
those who create playlists, and those who don't. We fell in separate categories.

While I would like to be more deliberate about creating playlists, each one curated to a specific mood, I usually like a song and listen from my Liked Songs list instead. At any given point, I usually listen to the top 20 songs in my liked songs, sorted by date added. So, I'm listening to the 20 most recent songs added, which usually happen to be the 20 newest songs I discovered, which usually happen to be the 20 songs I'm most interested in at any moment.

I love the feeling of listening to music that I know I like, but that still has that novel feeling where I haven't memorized every beat yet. I strongly associate music with time periods in my life too, so there's a block of 20-30 songs deep down in my Liked Songs that I associate with NYC the summer after 10th grade. And one for when I was in Seattle this summer.

It's chaotic, and a couple great songs end up falling through the cracks, buried underneath hundreds of other songs in my Liked Songs. The songs that don't fall are either from albums/artists I consistently listen to, or they're put in a playlist called "Brian," or another one called "Favorites." It's called "Brian" because we used my Spotify account at my mom's coffee shop, and each employee created their own playlist (titled with their name) that they'd play during their shift. I wouldn't call "Brian" and "Favorites" curated playlists though, cause they're more like Liked Songs 2.0 and Liked Songs 3.0, or Liked Songs (Filtered) and Liked Songs (More Filtered).

At this point my Liked Songs is 2443 songs long.
